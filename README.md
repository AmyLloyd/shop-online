# shop-online

## Description

The motivation for building this app is to provide online shopping services for my friend's online business. Using the Amazon shopping platform has been helpful to him, but there are fees and charges that could be avoided if he had his own working system. It has helped me to understand how the connections within a database are built by associations created by foreign and primary keys and the structure of Models. 

This experience makes me admire database systems and the structures that must be in place to hold the data with its many connections. And the logic and prediction that must go into determining what happens when. ... one item is deleted, or changed.
